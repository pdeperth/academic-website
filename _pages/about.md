Completing my PhD in cryptography at the *<a href='https://www.ens.psl.eu/'>école normale supérieure</a>* (ENS) of Paris and <a href="https://cosmian.com/">Cosmian</a>, advised by Pr. <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/david.pointcheval/index.php">David Pointcheval</a>.
I was previously a Research Engineer in the Polynomial Systems (<a href="https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/">PolSys</a>) team of the <a href="https://www.lip6.fr/">LIP6</a> Computer Science Department of Sorbonne université (Paris). I studied General Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at the *<a href="https://www.ec-lyon.fr/">école Centrale</a>* of Lyon, after two years of *<a href="https://www.stanislas.fr/unite-pedagogique/classes-preparatoires/filieres/cpge-scientifiques/">classes préparatoires</a>* in Maths, Physics and Engineering.

My research interests are focused on Asymmetric Cryptography, with works on Verifiable Computations on Homomorphic Ciphertexts, Functional Encryption, Registration-Based Encryption and Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms. I am also working on Standardization at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>) on behalf of <a href="https://cosmian.com/">Cosmian</a>.
